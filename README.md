# Ownr Business Registration: Save Up to $300 with RBC, Fast 15-Minute Setup, Perks Worth $16,000+

Starting a business in Canada used to mean dealing with lawyers, piles of paperwork, and fees that could easily hit thousands of dollars. Then Ownr showed up and flipped the script.

This RBC Ventures-backed platform has helped over 200,000 Canadian entrepreneurs register sole proprietorships and incorporate businesses without the headache of traditional methods. The real kicker? You can get the entire process done in about 15 minutes from your couch, and if you're smart about it, you might even get your money back.

## What Ownr Actually Does

Ownr is basically a one-stop shop for getting your business legally registered in Canada. Whether you're launching a side hustle as a sole proprietor or incorporating a full-blown company, the platform handles everything from business name searches to government filings to document storage.

Available in Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec, Ownr serves as the middleman between you and the government bureaucracy. Instead of trying to decode legal jargon or paying a lawyer $2,000+ to do it for you, Ownr's platform walks you through each step in plain English.

Here's what you get:

- Unlimited business name searches (so you can try out 50 variations if you want)
- All government filings and registration documents
- Digital minute book for storing corporate documents
- Compliance reminders so you don't miss important deadlines
- Access to legal agreement templates (NDAs, employment contracts, etc.)
- Customer support via chat and email

The platform also integrates with RBC's business banking services, which is where things get interesting from a savings perspective.

## Pricing Breakdown: What You'll Actually Pay

Ownr's pricing is straightforward, though it varies depending on your business structure and location.

| Business Type | Initial Cost | What's Included | Annual Subscription |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Sole Proprietorship** | $49 CAD + tax (one-time) | Business registration, unlimited name searches, document storage, Ownr Perks membership, chat support | None - one-time fee only |
| **Full Incorporation + Online Minute Book** | $499-$699 CAD + tax (varies by province) | Complete incorporation, government filings, minute book documents, 12 months platform access | $199/year after first year |
| **Managed Corporation Plan** | $499-$699 CAD + tax (initial incorporation) | Everything in Online Minute Book plan PLUS unlimited director/officer changes, legal agreement library, shareholder management tools | $599/year |

**Add-Ons (Annual):**
- Managed Shareholders: $297/year
- Managed Employees & Contractors: $99/year  
- Employee Stock Option Plan: $999/year

Provincial incorporation costs:
- **Ontario**: $599-$699 CAD (federal option available)
- **Alberta**: $599 CAD  
- **British Columbia**: $699 CAD
- **Quebec**: $599 CAD

The pricing includes all government fees, name search fees, and company formation documents. If you went directly to the government, you'd save maybe $100-200 upfront, but you'd be on your own for creating all the legally required corporate documents—which could cost you way more down the line if you mess something up.

## The RBC Cashback Deal: How to Get Your Money Back

Here's where Ownr gets clever. If you open an RBC business bank account within 60 days of registering, you can get money back:

- **Sole Proprietorship**: Up to $100 refund (basically covers your entire registration fee)
- **Incorporation**: $300 cashback

The catch? You need to keep the RBC business account open for at least one year. There's no minimum balance requirement, but if you close the account early, they'll charge back the rebate.

**How to claim it:**

1. Register your business through 👉 [Ownr](https://www.ownr.co)
2. Within 60 days, visit an RBC branch and open a business bank account
3. Log into your Ownr dashboard and click "Refund Me"
4. Wait 7-10 business days for the credit to hit your RBC account

Some users opt for the instant discount at checkout (where Ownr deducts the $49 or $300 upfront), but then you're required to open the RBC account. If you don't, they'll charge your credit card 60 days later.

Personally? If you're already planning to open a business bank account anyway, this deal is kind of a no-brainer. RBC's business accounts aren't the cheapest on the market, but getting $300 back makes it worth considering for at least the first year.

## The $16,000+ in Partner Perks

Beyond the RBC cashback, Ownr throws in access to deals from business partners. They claim it's worth over $16,000, though that number assumes you'd actually use all these services:

- **Xero**: 50% off first 3 months (saves ~$87)
- **QuickBooks**: 75% off Advanced Plan for 3 months (~$105)
- **AWS**: $5,000 in credits
- **HubSpot**: 20% off professional plan (~$2,136)  
- **H&R Block**: $100 off T2 corporate tax prep
- **Jobber**: 20% off 12-month plan (~$720)
- **Telus Business**: Various discounts on phone plans and security (~$1,080 combined)
- **OpenTable**: 3 months free Pro Plan (~$1,347)
- And a bunch more...

Will you actually save $16,000? Probably not unless you're planning to use every single one of these services. But if you need accounting software, cloud hosting, or a few other tools anyway, the perks can add up to real savings.

## How Fast Is It Really?

Ownr markets the "incorporate in 15 minutes" angle pretty hard. Is it true?

Sort of. The actual time *you* spend filling out forms and answering questions is probably 15-30 minutes. But then Ownr has to process everything, submit it to the government, and wait for approval.

Actual turnaround times:
- **Numbered company** (no custom name): Usually 1 business day
- **Named company in Ontario**: 1-5 business days  
- **Named company in Alberta**: 1 business day (after ID verification)
- **Named company in BC**: 7 business days (or 1 day with expedited fee)
- **Federal incorporation**: 1-5 business days

So while your part is quick, you're not getting incorporated in 15 minutes flat unless you go with a numbered company. Still faster than the traditional lawyer route, which can take weeks.

## The User Experience: What People Actually Say

Ownr has solid ratings on Google and generally positive reviews, but it's not perfect. Here's what users consistently mention:

**What people love:**
- Interface is genuinely easy to use, even for first-timers
- Documents are professionally prepared and legally sound
- The digital minute book makes compliance tracking way less painful
- Customer support (when you can reach them) is helpful and knowledgeable

**Common complaints:**
- Customer service is primarily email/chat-based with no phone support (unless you pay for the Managed Corporation plan)
- Some users report slow response times when issues come up
- The RBC cashback process can be confusing if you don't read the fine print
- Increasing costs for annual subscriptions caught some legacy users off-guard

One recurring theme: Ownr is great when everything goes smoothly, but if you hit a snag, getting help can be frustrating. This seems to be improving, but it's worth noting if you prefer having someone on the phone to walk you through problems.

## Who Should Actually Use Ownr?

**Perfect for:**
- First-time entrepreneurs who don't want to drop $2,000+ on a lawyer
- Solo founders or small teams with straightforward corporate structures  
- People comfortable with online platforms and following step-by-step instructions
- Anyone who values having all their corporate documents in one digital place

**Maybe not ideal for:**
- Complex corporate structures with multiple shareholders and classes of shares (get a lawyer)
- Businesses that need immediate phone support for legal questions
- Companies operating in provinces outside BC, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec
- People who prefer face-to-face guidance for major business decisions

**Compared to alternatives:**

If you incorporate directly with the government, you'll save maybe $150-250, but you're on your own for creating minute book documents, shareholder agreements, and all the other legally required paperwork. Miss something important, and it'll cost you way more to fix later.

Hire a lawyer, and you're looking at $1,500-3,000+, though you get personalized legal advice and custom documents. Worth it if your situation is complicated; overkill if you're just a freelancer going legit.

## Getting Started with Ownr

The process is pretty straightforward:

1. Visit 👉 [Ownr](https://www.ownr.co) and click "Get Started"
2. Choose your province
3. Select sole proprietorship or incorporation
4. Run unlimited name searches until you find one that's available
5. Fill in your business details (directors, shareholders, address, etc.)
6. Review everything and pay
7. Ownr processes and files with the government
8. You get your incorporation documents and corporate number

If you want the RBC cashback, make sure to open that business account within 60 days and claim your refund through the dashboard.

## The Bottom Line

Ownr isn't reinventing the wheel—it's just making it way easier to access something that used to require lawyers and lots of money. For straightforward incorporations and sole proprietorships, it's a solid middle ground between doing everything yourself and hiring expensive professionals.

The RBC cashback deal is legitimate and can save you real money if you're planning to open a business account anyway. The partner perks are nice-to-haves if you actually need those services. And the platform itself is genuinely user-friendly.

Is it perfect? No. Customer service could be better, and complex corporate structures still need lawyers. But for most small business owners in Canada just trying to get legal without going broke, Ownr gets the job done.

Want to see if it's right for your business? Check it out at 👉 [Ownr](https://www.ownr.co) and take advantage of the unlimited name searches to at least see what's available.

*Note: Business registration requirements vary by province. Ownr currently operates in Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec. The RBC cashback offer requires opening and maintaining a business bank account for one year. All pricing current as of February 2026.*
